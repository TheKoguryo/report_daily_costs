        ```

## Setup

1. SSH into the instance

2. Install the Python OCI SDK

    ```
    pip3 install oci
    ```

3. Copy the oci-daily-cost-report source into /home/opc

    ```
    sudo dnf install git
    git clone https://github.com/TheKoguryo/oci-daily-cost-report.git
    ```

    ```
    export ONS_TOPIC_ID=ocid1.onstopic.oc1.iad.aaaaaaaa.....
    export BUCKET_NAME=daily-costs-bucket
    ```

5. Update the value of alert-threshold, alert_threshold_n in run_oci-daily-cost-report.sh

    ```
    # cron schedule - 0 * * * * 
    # Notify at 23:00 UCT
    #
    # Check the yesterday's cost every hours that is under being calculated.
    * (Your monthly invoice might differ from this estimate. Usage data is typically delayed by approximately twenty four hours.)
    # at 23:00 UCT: Notify the yesterday's cost
    # at 00:00 UCT ~ 22:00 UCT: If the yesterday's cost is more than the cost of the day before yesterday and the difference is over threshold, notify at that time.
    # at 00:00 UCT ~ 22:00 UCT: At the same day, another notification will be occurred when the new difference is over the first notified difference + second threshold(alert_threshold_n)

    python3 $APPDIR/report_daily_costs_v2.py -ip --ons_topic_id $ONS_TOPIC_ID --bucket_name $BUCKET_NAME --alert_threshold 30 --alert_threshold_n 20

    ```

6. Create a cron job. In the terminal, type:

    ```
    crontab -e
    ```

7. Type ``i`` to insert a new line.
