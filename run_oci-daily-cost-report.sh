# (Your monthly invoice might differ from this estimate. Usage data is typically delayed by approximately twenty four hours.)
# at 23:00 UCT: Notify the yesterday's cost
# at 00:00 UCT ~ 22:00 UCT: If the yesterday's cost is more than the cost of the day before yesterday and the difference is over threshold, notify at that time.
# at 00:00 UCT ~ 22:00 UCT: At the same day, another notification will be occurred when the new difference is over the first notified difference + second threshold(alert_threshold_n)
